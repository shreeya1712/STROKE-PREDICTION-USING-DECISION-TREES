# STROKE-PREDICTION-USING-DECISION-TREE
Stroke is an extremely harmful disease which causes millions of deaths, damages and disabilities all around the world. This problem can be tackled by efficient recognition and preventive measures. Machine learning models which predict stroke possibility are of great importance as it can even save lives. The motivation behind this report is to develop a model based on decision trees which can provide a patient the probability of him/her experiencing a stroke in the future. Decision trees are selected as it is a suitable algorithm for classification and predictive purposes. Upon construction, a model of training accuracy score of 0.97 and test accuracy score of 0.95 is achieved. Further, performance analysis is carried out by building a confusion matrix, providing numbers of precision, recall, f1 score and so on. A classification report is also computed. Several data visualisations are also carried out at different stages of the process.
